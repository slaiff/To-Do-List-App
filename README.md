# Assignment5 - To-Do List App
This application provides an organized, visually pleasing, helpful tool to the user by organizing their input file into a to-do list! 
In it's current version, the app allows for input via a formatted text file (format specified in startup). The app then takes the file contents and formats it into a organized task-list/to-do list.

The user can then add further tasks, mark tasks as completed, and more. 
Future builds aim to add several new features, including a personal end-of-day summary, the ability to sort by type (title, due date, importance, status), and additional features such as delete, edit, save, and a built-in timer. 
Stay tuned ;)
